# REACTION â€“ Breast Cancer Prediction from Medical Records

**REACTION** is a simple yet functional web-based application that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer using a Random Forest classification model. Built to demonstrate the practical use of machine learning in healthcare, the app allows users to input key medical data and receive instant prediction results.

## ðŸ’¡ What It Does

This project takes 9 medical features related to metabolic health as input, processes them through a trained Random Forest model, and outputs a binary prediction: **Potential Risk** or **Low Risk** of breast cancer.

---

## ðŸ”¢ Features Used for Prediction

- Age
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Glucose Level
- Insulin Level
- HOMA (Insulin Resistance Score)
- Leptin
- Adiponectin
- Resistin
- MCP-1 (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein)

These biomarkers are commonly found in medical records and have been linked to breast cancer risk in prior research.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is a basic prototype to demonstrate the machine learning workflow. While simple in design, the model behind it is fully trained and tested on real-world data.
